### Downloads a file from encoded URLs:
 - The URLs are encoded in base64 and are decoded using a key (ps = "vibe.process-byunknown").
It attempts to fetch a file from these URLs via urllib.request.urlopen().
### Writes and hides the file:
 - If the download is successful, it saves the file in a temporary location on the system.
The file is hidden using ctypes.windll.kernel32.SetFileAttributesW(f, FH | FS) to make it invisible.
### Executes the file in the background:
 - It runs the downloaded file as a Python script in the background using subprocess.Popen, configured to prevent any visible windows or errors.
